we're all gonna make it brah
i am nuclear
progress has a price
dnf is no option
now its time to justify
love hate pain
nobody said it was easy
everything you know is a f*cking lie
mein Herz in Flammen
now its you vs the world
final sprint incoming
one more rep
im not alone, cause we are all soldiers
spacegliding
cosmo is a part of you
pegasus inside of you, only as strong as you believe
on the rays of the sun, a new dawn
the eye of the storm is a new beginning
the show must go on
